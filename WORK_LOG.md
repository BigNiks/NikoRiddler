| Aug 22 | 10:30-10:50 AM | I started by thinking about how I was going to solve the ASCII decryption code.<br/> I initially thought to use a sort of array list to store all the different ASCII values in.<br/> Then use said list to identify the meanings of the different values using a loop. While I am thinking about that, I am also working on decrypting the first code. |

Both my soulutions seemed to have worked. I am planning on decrypting #4 next time as well as finishing up the code for #1. |

I ran into trouble with #1 for a short while since I had forgotten about the fact that I needed to check whether the char was an uppercase or lowercase letter. |
